Socialism! Slavery Through Dependency
We Can Bearly Wait
I Like To Party And By Party I Mean Read Books
Reading Will Take You Everywhere
Worlds Okayest Welder
I Welded It Helded
Don't Worry I Welded it
I Know I'm On Fire Let Me Finish This Weld
The Hotter You Get The Faster We Come
Don't Hate Me Just Because I'm A Little Cooler
